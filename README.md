<h1>Proof Of Concept</h1>

<p>This is a software development process where we implement 15 to 16 design patterns using real life scenario individually but work as a group in Agile structure.</p>
<p>Main objective of this project is to understand Design patterns and refactoring concepts and Agile practices.</p>

<h3>Project will implement following design patterns</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Abstract Factory</li>
  <li>Builder Pattern</li>
  <li>Factory Method</li>
  <li>Prototype</li>
  <li>Singleton</li>
  <li>Adapter</li>
  <li>Bridge</li>
  <li>Composite</li>
  <li>Decorator</li>
  <li>Facade</li>
  <li>Flyweight</li>
  <li>Proxy</li>
  <li>Command</li>
  <li>Mediator</li>
  <li>Observer</li>
  <li>Visitor</li>
  <li>Template method</li>
  <li>Strategy</li>
  <li>State</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to work in team ?</h3>
<p>Every week team members choose 3 to 4 random design patterns and work independently and write <strong>Before</strong> and <strong>After</strong>stages of implementing design patterns.</p>
<p>Team members then can share knowledge of design pattern learnt previously to other team members who will be learning and implementing those design patterns.</p>
<p>It is suggested to choose a different dissimilar design pattern to that of your peers so that what you learn would be independent but it's not so important to choose a different design pattern necessarily. Sometimes, you could have overlap as well with one of your team members</p>
<p>You have to come up with your own example to show you have learnt that design pattern</p>
<p>Please avoid copying from internet as mark will be zero for that case</p>
