<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>This software development process involves creating a Library Catalogue application by implementing Object Oriented Programming initially and create a relationship between objects such as order, library employee, book, author and so on.</p>
<p>Main objective of this project is to understand all data structures in object oriented progreamming by using</p>
<ul>
  <li>Abstraction</li>
  <li>Inheritance</li>
  <li>Encapsulation</li>
  <li>Primitives</li>
  <li>Control Structure</li>
  <li>Use Multiple Design Patterns</li>
  <li>Unit Test Suite</li>
  <li>Understand and Implement Agile Framework</li>
  <li>Extreme Programming</li>
  <li>Code Review</li>
</ul>
<h3>This unit experiments lot of data structures switch, and find a chain of problems on code and experiment different design pattern on code</h3>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Solution is yet to be identified as it requires analyzing design patterns</p>
